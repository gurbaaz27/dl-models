# Deep Learning Models
Under the summer project at my institute **IIT Kanpur** "Model Zoo", we are learning and practising to implement and summarise various deep learning architectures and models.

Here is a list of the implemenations:
1. **Resnet** : [Original Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
   * Based on CNN, aimed to tackle the difficulty of training deeper networks without rise in training and testing error.
2. **InfoGAN** : [Original Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03657) (*Implemenatation under process*)
   * Based on DCGan, aimed at disentangled representation so that network learns systematically various meaningful features of      the input sample.
